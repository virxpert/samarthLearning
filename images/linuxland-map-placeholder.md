# Linuxland Map Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the Linuxland map image.

To make the learning more engaging, consider creating a colorful map of Linuxland that shows:
- Home Directory (Tux's starting point)
- Document Mountains
- Picture Valley
- Game Forest
- The Root Kingdom
- Hidden Dot Caves
- And other locations that represent Linux filesystem concepts

You can create this as a hand-drawn image, a digital illustration, or even a collaborative project with children as they progress through the adventures.
