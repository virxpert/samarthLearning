## How to Use This Guide

1. Start with the first adventure and progress in order
2. Read each story with your child
3. Help them try the commands in a real terminal
4. Complete the challenges together at the end of each adventure
5. Celebrate their progress as they become Linux wizards!

## Setting Up

To get the most out of these adventures, you'll need:

1. A computer with a Linux operating system (Ubuntu is a great choice for beginners)
2. A terminal program (which comes pre-installed on Linux)
3. An adult helper for the first few adventures

If you don't have Linux installed, you can:
- Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows
- Use Terminal on macOS (most commands work the same way)
- Try an online Linux terminal emulator

## Parents & Teachers

These adventures are designed to make learning Linux fun and approachable for children. Each story introduces commands gradually with child-friendly metaphors and plenty of practice opportunities. Feel free to adapt the stories to your child's interests or create your own Linux adventures!

The commands taught are safe for beginners, but adult supervision is recommended, especially for younger children or when using commands like `rm` that can delete files.

## Happy Exploring!

Remember, in Linuxland, learning happens through exploration and play. Don't worry about making mistakes - they're part of the adventure! Just have fun and keep exploring!
